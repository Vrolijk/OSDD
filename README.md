# Get started with Data Diodes

This Github is created to share knowledge about data diodes to a wider audience. Since the data diode concept is simple to understand we noticed that when starting with the data diode concept in the real world there are some barriers to overcome.
First is getting your hands on data diode hardware, this we solved in the below hardware section.
Second is how to transfer data through a data diode because unidirectional network traffic has some unforeseen issues like packet loss. This is described in packet loss (almost) explained. We think this is one of the main issues you need to understand and overcome.
Last is getting some first successes when using the data diode technology. For this we created the workshop based on open source tools to support you to send a message, an audio/video stream and a large (>1Gb+) batch file using the data diode.

By the end of the workshop you should be able to proceed with your own projects or research.

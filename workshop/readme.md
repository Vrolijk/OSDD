# Securing Your Network: A Hands-On Workshop on Data Diodes and Proxies
Welcome to this exciting workshop on the basics of data diodes and proxies. Over the next few hours, we will be diving into the world of network security and learning how to use two laptops named PING and PONG, a data diode, and proxies to secure data communication.

Throughout the workshop, we will be working with Ubuntu and learning how to update the operating system, change IP settings, and manipulate the ARP table. Additionally, we will test the connection from laptop PING to PONG and install software to start three different data streams through the data diode.

By the end of the workshop, you will have a strong understanding of data diodes and proxies, and how they can be used to enhance network security. So, let's get started and dive into the exciting world of network security!

1: The application/script needs to support uni-directional communication. UDP is the most common 
2: At the kernel 

## step 1: Prepare the data diode
If not allready prepared follow the instructions on https://github.com/Vrolijk/OSDD/blob/main/examples/25_euro_data-diode_demonstator.md <br>
After this connect PING to the IN (port 1) and PONG to OUT (port 5) connection.
